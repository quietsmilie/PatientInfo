# PatientInfo

Assumptions: 

  Phone Number should be US/CA format (10 digits)

  Date of Birth must be before or equal to today (cannot be in future) and does not include a time



To Compile:
   
  Open Solution in Visual Studio (I used Community Edition, but VS Code should work as well)
  
  Choose to Run wthout debugging and then access via localhost the port number provided by the IDE (the solution is currently configured to launch and display the blank list of patients at start-up)
